# SocialExpectations

This research is devoted to the study of social expectations, and the purpose is to elaborate the instrument of their measurement based on the main spheres of influence.
The study is conducted within the framework of a mixed methodology: a series of semi-structured interviews and a survey. In the first stage, 15 interviews were conducted with middle-aged people because it is this age category that has the widest spectrum of areas in which social expectations are expressed. In the second stage, both online and offline surveys (256 participants) are conducted in order to verify the elaborated scale of social expectations and to confirm assumptions made on the quantitative stage.
As a result of the qualitative stage, the most important spheres of social expectations were distinguished, and it was revealed how they can potentially influence individual behavior. As a result of the quantitative stage the scale of social expectations was elaborated, and its predictive power was analyzed. By verifying the predictive power of social expectations on behavioral attitudes, it was found that they influence primarily on goal setting, motivation, opinion orientation, emotional experience, and decision making.
